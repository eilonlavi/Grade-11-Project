# Grade-11-Project
By Eilon Lavi and Khasir Hean
This is a multiplayer game played on a LAN network.
At least three different programs need to be run simultaneously:
The server program, and at least two different instances of the client program on different computers 
(though one can be on the same computer as the server), with the ip of the server configured.
Essentially, the server acts as the CPU of the game, and clients act as UIs.
That is, the server simulates the actual game, and sends messages to the clients saying what to show on the screen.
The clients in turn inform the server of user key presses.
